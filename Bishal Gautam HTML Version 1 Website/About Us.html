        <p>A person is a being that has certain capacities or attributes such as reason, 
            morality, consciousness or self-consciousness, and being a part of a culturally 
            established form of social relations such as kinship, ownership of property, or
             legal responsibility.Personhood is the status of being a person. Defining personhood
              is a controversial topic in philosophy and law, and is closely tied to legal and political
               concepts of citizenship, equality, and liberty. According to common worldwide general 
               legal practice, only a natural person or legal personality has rights, protections, 
               privileges, responsibilities, and legal liability. Personhood continues to be a topic 
               of international debate, and has been questioned during the abolition of slavery and 
               the fight for women's rights, in debates about abortion, fetal rights, and in animal 
               rights advocacy.</p>

             <p>In addition to the question of personhood, of what makes a being count as a person
                  to begin with, there are further questions about personal identity and self: both
                   about what makes any particular person that particular person instead of another, 
                   and about what makes a person at one time the same person as they were or will be 
                   at another time despite any intervening changes.Various debates have focused on questions
                    about the personhood of different classes of entities. Historically, the personhood of 
                    women, and slaves has been a catalyst of social upheaval. In most societies today, postnatal
                     humans are defined as persons. Likewise, certain legal entities such as corporations, sovereign
                      states and other polities, or estates in probate are legally defined as persons.</p>
